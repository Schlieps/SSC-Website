                            <p>
                            Ani moved from Vietnam to the U.S. when she was 8 years old with her family. She has strong ties to her
                            culture and the history as her grandfather is a war veteran, and so are many other family members. She has
                            been involved in and has great interest in human rights issues and charitable causes.
                            <p>
                            She is an alum University of Washington, with a concentration in Electrical Engineering. She devotes
                            her engineering knowledge as a research engineer at UW Medicine Applied Physics Laboratory. There
                            she helps develop non-invasive technology that treat kidney stones and tumors.
                            <p>
                            Ani has a passion for arts, in fact it was her love of art that ironically lead her to become
                            an engineer. As she believes in having interdisciplinary skills, one of the many things she does outside
                            of work is putting her effort in supporting Seattle Social Circle â€“ connecting the community closer
                            to the arts and charitable causes.
