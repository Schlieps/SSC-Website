                            <p>
                            Rizza was born and raised in the Philippines. She moved to Washington State 7 years ago after she
                            completed her degree of Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management. Travelling the world, studying
                            cultures and learning people’s different beliefs in life has always been her love and interest,
                            she is always curious with what the world offers as she believes that there is a lot more to life
                            out there.

                            One of the hobbies that Rizza loves to do is hiking – she’s conquered even one of the biggest
                            mountains in Washington State, including Mt. Adams, St. Helens, day through hiked The Enchantments
                            &amp; many more. She is now preparing and planning to do the Mt. Rainier summit. Rizza loves to share
                            her culture by cooking. She loves to cook and have a small gathering with friends – sharing different
                            dishes and enjoying each other’s company. In her country, hospitality and food is important whenever
                            there are invited guests or friends. One of Filipino’s belief is that food’s what brings joy and
                            makes everybody closer together.
