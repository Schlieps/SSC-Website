                            Arian Naghibi was born and raised in Iran, and moved to the Seattle area in 2006 at the age of 18 to start a new chapter
                            in his life. After finishing his graduate school and getting into work industry, he realized it's not just about what you
                            know, but who you are and who you know. So he decided to dive into many social and networking events to stretch his comfort zone.
                            <p>
                            As an immigrant, he enjoys meeting new people from different cultures and gets to know who they are
                            regardless of their religious or political background. After attending couple events hosted by
                            Seattle Social Circle, he decided to be part of the team and add value to people's lives
                            by serving them to the best of his abilities.
                            <p>
                            Some of Arian's hobbies are hiking, camping, road trips, volleyball, tennis, reading,
                            EDM shows, and cooking.
