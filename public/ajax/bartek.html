                    Bartek was born &amp; raised in Poland, and moved to the Seattle area when he was 24 to pursue his career in
                    the computer industry. Somewhere down the line, he realized how important it is to know people and be able
                    to communicate with them well, in order to achieve anything in life and to simply have fun. Hence Bartek
                    started organizing house parties on a regular basis, which eventually grew out of proportion, and that's
                    how Seattle Social Circle was born. In parallel, he enjoys business networking, in search of potential future
                    business partners he can found a start-up with.
                    <p>
                    Bartek tried a myriad of hobbies to see what works best for him. The ones that stuck the longest with him
                    are snowboarding, Latin dance (bachata &amp; salsa) and hiking. He occasionally enjoys board games, motorcycle rides,
                    skydiving, eating (a little bit too much), traveling, or heck... learning a new language.
                    <p>
                    To stay healthy, Bartek likes doing triathlons once or twice a year, and pepper in a half marathon here and there.
                    He occasionally makes a presence at a yoga class, but it's a rather rare sighting.
