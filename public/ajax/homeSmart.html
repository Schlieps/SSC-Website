                Chris' journey into a career as a real estate professional was via the U.S. Navy.
                Seriously! After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy as a young naval officer,
                Chris befriended a retired Navy couple who were real estate brokers.
                They took him under their wing and explained that real estate was a career field
                ideally suited to him because it would play to his strong suits as a detail-oriented
                analytical thinker, consummate social butterfly, and most importantly, allow him
                to continue to serve friends and clients post-Navy.
